# What Is Pascalsweeper
Pascalsweeper is an open source minesweeper clone. While its pretty poorly coded it is still a decent example of how even with little experience you can create something graphical with Lazarus and its controls.

Keep in mind this isn't an ideal way to write a minesweeper clone. Its just a really dumb thing I made and while it works it could be literally a hundred times better.
